# Good Habits Activity Module (1.2.2) for Moodle #

The intention of this plugin is to help track habits over time. Within an e-learning context this may help cultivate behaviours that improve learning outcomes.

## Overview of features

- Habit tracking by day, custom range of days or by week.
- Every calendar entry allows for rating by both effort and outcome.
- Granular access control.
- Uses the Privacy API to allow for control over user data.
- Create breaks for stretches of time in which you do not want to track habits.
- Keyboard shortcuts (number keys to set values, enter key to save).
- Can track activity completion based on user entries.

## 1.2.2 Notes
- Minor code style updates.

## 1.2.1 Notes
- Add *review* feature. If enabled, allows admin to review the habit calendars of others on the course.
- Improved responsiveness of the design so this activity will work on phones, tablets and smaller screens.
- Changed how keyboard shortcuts work. The first number key sets *effort*, the second sets *outcome* and the enter key saves the entry.
- Effort/outcome can now be set by clicking on the corresponding square in the grid.
- Clicking/tapping the current entry circle will now save the entry (if you have selected new values) or cancel (if you have not).

## 1.1.2 Notes
- Minor maintenance updates (add thirdpartylibs.xml, change lang strings to sentence case).

## 1.1 Notes

- Add support for Backup/Restore.
- Add support for Completion Tracking.
- Fix issues with Privacy API implementation.
- Improve code documentation and style to fit guidelines.
